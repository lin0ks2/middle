Add these <script> tags in your index.html (after existing core scripts) to enable the medium patch pack:

<!-- Medium Patch Pack v1.6.1 -->
<script src="trainer.medium.patch.js?v=1.6.1"></script>
<script src="mistakes.thresholds.patch.js?v=1.6.1"></script>
<script src="stars.rules.patch.js?v=1.6.1"></script>

Place them AFTER:
  - app.trainer.js
  - app.ui.view.js
  - app.mistakes.js / app.favorites.js

Reason: the patches wrap existing functions and listen to custom events.
If your app does not emit 'lexitron:*' events, call the exposed helpers from your handlers:
  - StarsRules.onCorrect(word.id) on correct answer
  - StarsRules.onIdk(word.id) on "I don't know"
  - MistakesGate.onFail(word) on wrong answer
  - MistakesGate.onIdk(word) on "I don't know"
